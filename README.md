# geminAI

This hosts the code for the geminAI website, hosted and deployed with heroku, that uses my geminAI model for creating an AI generated horoscope. The front end is written in HTML, while the back end is written in Python. This uses a text GENN to generate horoscopes after being trained on a large dataset of horoscopes. This also uses Flask in order to call the model from the front end.
